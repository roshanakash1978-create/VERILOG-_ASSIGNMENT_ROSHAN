# APB Protocol Layered Testbench

This project has a SystemVerilog testbench that checks an Advanced Peripheral Bus design. The project is set up in a way and works with EDA Playground.

## File Structure and Overview

The testbench is made up of smaller parts and follows the standard SystemVerilog verification architecture. Here is what you will find in the DAY7/APB/tb directory:

### Design and Top-Level Files

* **design.sv**: This file has the Register Transfer Level code for the APB design we are testing.

* **testbench.sv**: This is the testbench module. It creates the APB design, the physical interface and the clock and reset signals. It is also where EDA Playground starts.

### Verification Environment Components

* **interface.sv**: This file defines the APB protocol signals, clocking blocks and modports. These are used to connect the testbench parts to the APB design.

* **transaction.sv**: This file defines what an APB transaction looks like. It has fields for the address, data and read/write control.

* **generator.sv**: This part creates transactions and sends them to the driver.

* **driver.sv**: The driver gets transactions from the generator. Sends them to the APB interface.

* **monitor.sv**: The monitor watches the APB interface. Turns the activity into transactions. It then sends these transactions to the scoreboard.

* **scoreboard.sv**: The scoreboard gets the transactions from the monitor. Checks if they are correct. It does this by comparing the expected results with the output from the APB design.

* **environment.sv**: This is the container that creates and connects the generator, driver, monitor and scoreboard.

* **test.sv**: This is the test case layer. It creates the environment sets up the test and starts the simulation.

## Running on EDA Playground

To run this simulation on EDA Playground follow these steps:

1.  **Testbench and Design**:

* Put the testbench code in the Testbench window.

* Put the design code in the Design window.

2.  **Include Directives**: Make sure your testbench file includes all the files, in the right order. For example:

```systemverilog

`include "interface.sv"

`include "transaction.sv"

`include "generator.sv"

`include "driver.sv"

`include "monitor.sv"

`include "scoreboard.sv"

`include "environment.sv"

`include "test.sv"

```

3.  **Simulator Selection**: Choose a simulator from the list on the left.

4.  **Run**: Click the Run button to start the simulation. The testbench will. Run, checking the Advanced Peripheral Bus design.
