Introduction:
-------------
The basic operation principles of the FIFO memory structure are shown in this project. These include:
The ability to perform synchronous writes and reads via a common clock.
Full and Empty flags which prevent any possible buffer overflow/underflow conditions.
A constrained random testbench using SystemVerilog classes.

Design Components
------------------
1. fifo Module (DUT)
The Design Under Test (DUT) uses circular buffer implementation using an 8-bit wide, 8-entry memory array (mem[7:0]).
Pointers: 3-bit wide wr_ptr and rd_ptr used for tracking head/tail pointers.
Flags: * full: Set when next position of the write pointer equals the read pointer.
empty: Set when the write pointer equals the read pointer.

2. fifo_transaction Class
The stimulus creation is encapsulated within this class.
Randomization: rand variables used in SystemVerilog for wr_en, rd_en and data_in.
Constraints: rw_dist_c constraint using dist to set distribution of write and read enable signals:
wr_en: 50% probability to be high.
rd_en: 40% probability to be high.

3. tb_fifo Module
The testbench takes care of the lifecycle of simulation process:
Reset Handling: Initializing the DUT in a known state.
Stimulus Generation: Execution of a repeat(10) loop that performs randomization of transactions and applying the stimulus to the DUT interface.
Data Capturing: Capture data_out, full and empty signals from the DUT after every transaction to make sure that the stimulus object has been updated with real design response.

Simulation Waveforms:
---------------------
The waveforms below, from EPWave, show the following behavior:
Empty condition: True initially until writing any data.
Operations: Follows proper sequence for storing and fetching data.
Pointer Conditions: Shows regular FIFO circular queue operations.
